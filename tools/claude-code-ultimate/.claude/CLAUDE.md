# Claude Code Ultimate - Project Context

## Project Overview
Open-source project to enhance Claude Code with 100-1000x improvements through advanced configurations, multi-LLM orchestration, infinite context windows, and enterprise-grade features.

## Mission
Transform Claude Code from a powerful assistant into an ultra-intelligent, self-evolving development platform that operates at superhuman levels of efficiency and accuracy.

## Key Enhancements
1. **Infinite Context**: Break the 200k token limit using distributed storage
2. **Multi-LLM Orchestra**: Coordinate Claude, GPT-4, Llama, Gemini for specialized tasks
3. **Visual Intelligence**: Screen recording and visual context processing
4. **Parallel Execution**: 50-100 concurrent processes for massive speed gains
5. **Self-Evolution**: Knowledge graphs that learn and improve continuously

## Development Guidelines
- Test every configuration before marking complete
- Document all test commands in ENHANCEMENT_MATRIX.md
- Follow priority levels (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM)
- Update progress tracking after each session
- Create reusable, modular configurations

## Current Status
- Total Items: 82 configurations
- Completed: 0/82 (0%)
- Active Focus: Starting Phase 1 - Core Configuration Files

## Testing Protocol
1. Implement configuration
2. Write test script/command
3. Run tests in isolated environment
4. Document results in matrix
5. Mark as completed only after full verification

## Success Metrics
- All critical items functional
- 100x speed improvement demonstrated
- Enterprise features operational
- Multi-LLM orchestration working
- Knowledge graph learning active

## Commands
- Check progress: `cat ENHANCEMENT_MATRIX.md | grep "Overall Progress"`
- Run tests: `bash test_all.sh`
- Quick setup: `bash installers/quick-start.sh`
- Full setup: `bash installers/enterprise.sh`
