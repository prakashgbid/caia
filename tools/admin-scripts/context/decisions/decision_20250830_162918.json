  "title": "Transformed to Unified AI Database Architecture",
  "description": "Replaced all file-based logging with a unified SQLite database that captures EVERYTHING - operations, prompts, choices, patterns, tool usage, code artifacts. Created ML learning pipeline that continuously learns from the database to build knowledge graphs, detect patterns, predict user choices, and optimize tool selection. This enables true AI learning and autonomous behavior as all data is now interconnected and queryable.",
