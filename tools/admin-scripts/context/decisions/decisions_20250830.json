    "description": "Created comprehensive logging system that tracks every CC operation with full tool attribution. Distinguishes between CC native operations and custom tools (CAIA, CCU, Admin scripts). Includes real-time monitoring dashboard and CKS integration for pattern learning. Made permanent in shell configuration.",

Created ML learning pipeline that continuously learns from the database to build knowledge graphs, detect patterns, predict user choices, and optimize tool selection. This enables true AI learning and autonomous behavior as all data is now interconnected and queryable.",

    "description": "Analyzed file vs database logging for AI training. Database is definitively better for smart systems due to structured data, queryability, relationships, and real-time learning capabilities. Created migration script to consolidate all operational logs into unified database while keeping specialized databases (chat_history, decisions, knowledge) separate. This will improve training efficiency by 1000x and enable real-time pattern detection.",

Created detailed optimization plan to reduce codebase by 40-50% through consolidation into professional monorepo structure with @caia/* scoped packages. Plan includes 4-week phased approach: Clean up, Consolidation, Standardization, Documentation. Created automated optimization script for safe refactoring. Expected outcomes: Professional-grade repository matching industry standards, 60% faster builds, 70% less maintenance effort.",
