## Market Positioning

### What ORCHESTRA Is:

**1. LLM Orchestration Platform** ‚úÖ (Primary)
- Coordinates multiple LLMs
- Manages provider routing
- Handles consensus building
- Enables complex workflows

**2. AI Infrastructure Layer** ‚úÖ
- Sits between applications and LLMs
- Provides abstraction layer
- Handles provider management
- Manages costs and performance

**3. AI Agent Framework** ‚úÖ (Secondary)
- Enables agent-like behaviors
- Supports autonomous workflows
- Provides memory and context
- Facilitates multi-step reasoning

### What ORCHESTRA Is NOT:

**‚ùå NOT just an MCP Server**
- MCP is ONE protocol we support
- We're protocol-agnostic
- Much broader than MCP tools

**‚ùå NOT just an Agent**
- We're the platform agents are built on
- We enable agent creation
- We're infrastructure, not application

**‚ùå NOT just an LLM**
- We don't train models
- We orchestrate existing LLMs
- We're a layer above LLMs

**‚ùå NOT just a Gateway/Proxy**
- We add intelligence (consensus, debate)
- We're not just routing requests
- We transform and enhance responses
