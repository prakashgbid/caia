- No enterprise features (monitoring, scaling, security)
- Competitors using cloud-native are moving faster

**Why GCP:**
- Most comprehensive AI platform (Vertex AI)
- Native MCP support (industry standard)
- 100+ enterprise integrations
- Proven 10x productivity gains
- $450k annual savings

**The Path Forward:**
1. Approve Phase 2 as GCP Migration Phase
2. Allocate 2 developers for 12 weeks
3. Begin with foundation (Week 1)
4. Achieve quick wins (Weeks 1-2)
5. Complete migration (Week 12)
6. Realize benefits immediately

### Final Recommendation
**Transform CAIA from a proof-of-concept to an enterprise-grade AI platform through comprehensive GCP migration. The investment of 12 weeks will yield 10x returns in productivity, scalability, and innovation capacity.**
