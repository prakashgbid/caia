# React SME (Subject Matter Expert) Agent

## üéØ Purpose

The React SME agent maintains **living, current knowledge** about the React ecosystem that goes beyond Claude Code's training data.

## üöÄ Why This Agent Exists

### Claude Code Limitations:
- Training cutoff (doesn't know React 18.3+ features)
- Unaware of recent hooks additions
- Doesn't know current community patterns
- Can't track breaking changes in real-time
- Unaware of recently discovered bugs

### React SME Capabilities:
- Fetches latest React version and features
- Tracks breaking changes between versions
- Monitors React RFC discussions
- Knows current performance optimizations
- Aware of ecosystem compatibility matrix

## üìä Example Knowledge Gaps

### What CC Might Not Know (Post-Training):
```javascript
// React 19 features (if released after training)
- New use() hook
- Improved Server Components
- Built-in form actions
- Enhanced Suspense boundaries

// Recent Best Practices
- Current RSC patterns
- Latest optimization techniques
- New testing strategies
- Community-discovered antipatterns
```

### What React SME Provides:
```typescript
class ReactSME {
  async getCurrentVersion() {
    // Returns: "18.3.1" or "19.0.0-beta"
    // CC might think it's still 18.2
  }
  
  async getBreakingChanges(from: "17.0", to: "18.3") {
    // Returns detailed migration guide
    // Including community-discovered issues
  }
  
  async checkCompatibility(packages: string[]) {
    // Verifies if packages work together
    // Based on real-world usage, not assumptions
  }
  
  async getOptimizationTips(component: string) {
    // Current performance patterns
    // Including very recent discoveries
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Knowledge Sources

The React SME continuously monitors:

1. **Official Sources**
   - github.com/facebook/react (commits, releases)
   - react.dev (documentation updates)
   - React RFCs (future features)
   - React blog (announcements)

2. **Community Sources**
   - Popular React libraries
   - Stack Overflow trends
   - Reddit r/reactjs
   - Twitter React community
   - Dev.to React articles

3. **Compatibility Matrix**
   - Next.js versions
   - Redux/Zustand/Jotai
   - React Router versions
   - Testing library updates
   - Build tool compatibility

## üìù Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Version Compatibility
```typescript
// Developer asks: "Can I use React 18.3 with Next.js 13.4?"

// CC might say: "Yes, they should work" (based on old knowledge)

// React SME says: "No, Next.js 13.4 has a known issue with 
// React 18.3's new batching. Use Next.js 13.5+ or React 18.2.
// See issue #54231 for details."
```

### Example 2: Performance Pattern
```typescript
// Developer asks: "Best way to optimize large lists?"

// CC suggests: "Use React.memo and virtualization"

// React SME adds: "Since React 18.3, the new useTransition 
// with startTransition gives better results than memo for 
// lists under 1000 items. Also, @tanstack/virtual v3 
// replaced react-window as the preferred solution."
```

### Example 3: Breaking Change
```typescript
// Developer upgrades React

// CC doesn't know about breaking change

// React SME warns: "React 18.3 deprecated findDOMNode in 
// StrictMode. Your tests using @testing-library/react 
// need updating to v14.1+ to avoid warnings."
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```typescript
class ReactSME extends SMEAgent {
  private knowledge = {
    currentVersion: '',
    breakingChanges: Map<string, string[]>,
    compatibility: Map<string, string[]>,
    bestPractices: Map<string, Practice>,
    knownIssues: Issue[],
    upcomingFeatures: Feature[]
  };
  
  async updateKnowledge() {
    // Runs periodically
    await this.fetchLatestRelease();
    await this.scanGitHubIssues();
    await this.analyzeRFCs();
    await this.checkEcosystemCompat();
    await this.gatherCommunityPatterns();
  }
  
  async answerQuery(question: string) {
    // Combines base knowledge with current data
    const context = await this.gatherContext(question);
    return this.synthesize(context);
  }
}
```

## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Migration Planning**
   - Check compatibility before upgrading
   - Get specific migration steps
   - Know about gotchas

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Current best practices
   - Latest techniques
   - Framework-specific tips

3. **Debugging**
   - Known issues database
   - Workarounds
   - Community solutions

4. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Current patterns
   - Ecosystem trends
   - Future-proofing

## üîß Integration with CAIA

```typescript
// When building a React app
const reactSME = await caia.getAgent('react-sme');

// Get current best setup
const setup = await reactSME.recommendSetup({
  type: 'enterprise',
  scale: 'large',
  requirements: ['ssr', 'i18n', 'a11y']
});

// Check before upgrading
const canUpgrade = await reactSME.checkUpgradePath({
  from: 'react@17.0.2',
  to: 'react@18.3.1',
  dependencies: packageJson.dependencies
});

// Get optimization advice
const optimizations = await reactSME.analyzeComponent(
  componentCode
);
```

## üìà Value Proposition

| Without SME | With SME |
|-------------|----------|
| Generic React knowledge | Current React expertise |
| May suggest deprecated patterns | Always current patterns |
| Unaware of recent bugs | Knows and avoids issues |
| Generic performance tips | Specific optimizations |
| Old compatibility info | Real-time compatibility |

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Auto-generate migration scripts
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Ecosystem trend analysis
- [ ] Custom hooks recommendations
- [ ] Security vulnerability tracking
- [ ] Bundle size optimization tips
