## ðŸ”’ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The CAIA team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.
2. Send your report privately to: security@caia-project.org
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
   - Location of affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Patch Development**: Based on severity
  - Critical: Within 48 hours
  - High: Within 1 week
  - Medium: Within 2 weeks
  - Low: Within 1 month

## Disclosure Process

1. Security report received and acknowledged
2. CAIA team investigates and validates the issue
3. Fix developed and tested
4. Security advisory prepared
5. Fix released with advisory
6. Credit given to reporter (unless anonymity requested)

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - API keys
   - Passwords
   - Private keys
   - Tokens

2. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user input
   - Use parameterized queries for databases
   - Implement proper type checking

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Regularly audit with `npm audit`
   - Use Dependabot for automatic updates

4. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use secure authentication methods
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Never store passwords in plain text

### Agent Security

Since CAIA involves autonomous agents:

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limits for external API calls
   - Prevent resource exhaustion

2. **Sandboxing**
   - Isolate agent execution when possible
   - Limit file system access
   - Control network access

3. **Input Sanitization**
   - Validate all agent inputs
   - Prevent prompt injection
   - Sanitize generated code

4. **Output Validation**
   - Review agent-generated code
   - Validate agent decisions
   - Implement safety checks

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

- **Secure Communication**: All agent communication encrypted
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for agents
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of agent actions
- **Sandboxing**: Isolated execution environments
- **Rate Limiting**: API call throttling

### Security Tools

```bash
# Run security audit
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Check for secrets
npm run security:secrets

# Validate dependencies
npm run security:deps
```

## Security Checklist for PRs

## Known Security Considerations

### LLM Security
- Prompt injection prevention
- Output sanitization
- Token limit enforcement
- Cost control mechanisms

### API Security
- Rate limiting
- Authentication required
- API key rotation
- Request validation

### Code Generation Security
- Sandboxed execution
- Code review requirements
- Static analysis
- Vulnerability scanning
