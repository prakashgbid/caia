# Autonomix

    Autonomous AI engine that intelligently determines and executes tasks
    without manual mode switching.
    

## 🎯 Unique Value Proposition

First-of-its-kind autonomous AI engine | Intelligent task detection and execution | Zero-configuration operation

## 📋 Features

- Intelligent intent detection and task routing
- Multi-agent collaboration capabilities
- Battle-tested in production environments
- Zero-configuration autonomous operation
- Fully async and high-performance
- Comprehensive test coverage

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install autonomix
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prakashgbid/autonomix-engine.git
cd autonomix-engine
pip install -e .
```

## 📖 Quick Start

```python
from autonomix import AutonomixEngine

# Initialize the autonomous engine
engine = AutonomixEngine()

# Process tasks autonomously
result = await engine.process_autonomously("Create a web scraper for product data")
print(result)

# Let Autonomix think and act independently
insights = await engine.think_autonomously("optimization strategies")
print(insights)
```
