# 🧠 Autonomous ChatGPT Agent System

**A truly independent, self-thinking agent that manages multiple ChatGPT sessions with human-like behavior.**

## 🎯 Philosophy: Agentic Independence

This is NOT a tool or server that waits to be called. This is an **autonomous agent** that:

- **Thinks before acting** - Has internal reasoning and planning
- **Pursues goals independently** - You give it objectives, it figures out how
- **Manages multiple sessions** - Up to 3-5 parallel ChatGPT windows
- **Behaves like a human** - Typing delays, reading time, breaks
- **Learns and adapts** - Remembers what works, avoids what doesn't
- **Avoids detection** - Carefully manages activity to appear human

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install playwright numpy
playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Run Autonomous Agent

```python
from autonomous_agent import AutonomousChatGPTAgent

# Create agent
agent = AutonomousChatGPTAgent(max_parallel_sessions=3)
await agent.initialize()

# Give it a goal - it handles everything else
await agent.pursue_goal(
    "Build a complete web scraping system with monitoring"
)

# The agent now works independently:
# - Breaks down the goal
# - Plans approach
# - Manages ChatGPT sessions
# - Completes tasks
# - Saves results
```

## 🧠 Key Features

### 1. **Independent Thought Process**

The agent doesn't just execute commands - it THINKS:

```python
thought = agent.thought_process.think({
    'goals': current_goals,
    'sessions': available_sessions,
    'history': past_actions
})

# Returns:
{
    'reasoning': ["I have 3 active goals", "Focusing on highest priority"],
    'next_action': {'action': 'research', 'approach': 'iterative'},
    'learnings': ["Most productive at 10am", "Need breaks after 30 min"]
}
```

### 2. **Human-Like Behavior**

Avoids bot detection through natural patterns:

- **Typing Speed**: 40-80 WPM with variation
- **Reading Time**: 200-300 WPM based on content
- **Thinking Pauses**: 1-3 seconds for questions
- **Break Patterns**: Every 25-45 minutes
- **Daily Rhythms**: Different behavior morning vs evening

### 3. **Multi-Session Management**

Intelligently manages parallel sessions:

```python
Sessions:
├── Session 1 (RESEARCH) - Deep investigation
├── Session 2 (ANALYTICAL) - Code/data analysis  
└── Session 3 (CREATIVE) - Content generation

Rotation: Every 20 minutes
Rest: After 30-45 minutes per session
Max Parallel: 3 (appears human)
```

### 4. **Goal Decomposition**

Automatically breaks down high-level goals:

```
Goal: "Build a web scraper"
↓
Subtasks:
1. Research current web scraping techniques
2. Design architecture
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add error handling
5. Test implementation
6. Optimize performance
```

### 5. **Memory & Learning**

Persistent memory across sessions:

```
~/.autonomous-agent/memory/
├── agent_state.json      # Goals, progress
├── research_*.json        # Research results
├── code_*.py             # Generated code
├── content_*.txt         # Created content
└── agent_20241208.log    # Activity logs
```

## 🎮 Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Research Agent

```python
agent = AutonomousChatGPTAgent()
await agent.initialize()

# Research autonomously
await agent.pursue_goal(
    "Research quantum computing applications in cryptography"
)

# Agent will:
# 1. Break into research questions
# 2. Systematically investigate
# 3. Compile findings
# 4. Save research documents
```

### Pattern 2: Development Agent

```python
# Build something complex
await agent.pursue_goal(
    "Create a Python package for async web scraping with rate limiting"
)

# Agent will:
# 1. Research best practices
# 2. Design architecture
# 3. Write code iteratively
# 4. Test and refine
# 5. Document everything
```

### Pattern 3: Creative Agent

```python
# Creative tasks
await agent.pursue_goal(
    "Design a mobile app UI for meditation tracking"
)

# Agent will:
# 1. Research design trends
# 2. Generate concepts
# 3. Create detailed descriptions
# 4. Iterate on feedback
```

## 🔒 Anti-Detection Features

### Human Patterns Implemented:

1. **Variable Response Times**
   - Never instant responses
   - Natural reading/thinking delays
   - Random micro-pauses

2. **Session Limits**
   - Max 3 concurrent (normal human behavior)
   - Sessions rest after 30-45 minutes
   - Daily patterns (less active at night)

3. **Natural Flow**
   - Questions followed by follow-ups
   - Corrections and clarifications
   - Thank you messages

4. **Activity Patterns**
   ```python
   Morning (6-9am): Quick checks, light tasks
   Deep Work (9-12pm): Complex analysis
   Afternoon (1-5pm): Productive tasks
   Evening (5-8pm): Mixed activity
   Night (8-11pm): Creative work
   Late Night: Minimal activity
   ```

## 🎯 Autonomous Behaviors

### The agent exhibits these independent behaviors:

1. **Goal Pursuit**
   - Breaks down objectives
   - Plans approach
   - Executes without supervision
   - Adapts when blocked

2. **Self-Management**
   - Monitors session health
   - Takes breaks when needed
   - Rotates sessions
   - Cleans up resources

3. **Learning**
   - Tracks successful patterns
   - Avoids past failures
   - Optimizes over time
   - Builds knowledge base

4. **Decision Making**
   - Chooses best session for task
   - Prioritizes goals
   - Allocates resources
   - Manages time

## 📊 Monitoring

### Real-time Status

```python
# Check what the agent is thinking/doing
status = agent.get_current_status()

{
    'active_goal': 'Build web scraper',
    'progress': '60% (3/5 subtasks)',
    'current_action': 'Writing error handling code',
    'sessions': {
        'active': 2,
        'resting': 1
    },
    'last_thought': 'Need to add retry logic for failed requests'
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Behavior Modes

```python
# Conservative mode (very human-like)
agent = AutonomousChatGPTAgent(max_parallel_sessions=2)
agent.human_mode = True
agent.aggressive_mode = False

# Balanced mode (default)
agent = AutonomousChatGPTAgent(max_parallel_sessions=3)

# Aggressive mode (faster but riskier)
agent = AutonomousChatGPTAgent(max_parallel_sessions=5)
agent.aggressive_mode = True  # Use with caution!
```

### Session Strategies

```python
# Research-heavy work
agent.session_distribution = {
    SessionPriority.RESEARCH: 2,
    SessionPriority.ANALYTICAL: 1
}

# Development work
agent.session_distribution = {
    SessionPriority.ANALYTICAL: 2,
    SessionPriority.CREATIVE: 1
}
```

## 🌟 Advanced Features

### 1. **Collaborative Goals**

```python
# Multiple agents working together
agent1 = AutonomousChatGPTAgent()
agent2 = AutonomousChatGPTAgent()

# Share memory
shared_memory = SharedMemory()
agent1.memory = shared_memory
agent2.memory = shared_memory

# Pursue related goals
await agent1.pursue_goal("Research ML algorithms")
await agent2.pursue_goal("Implement the best algorithm")
```

### 2. **Scheduled Autonomy**

```python
# Agent works on schedule
agent.schedule = {
    'morning': ['Check news', 'Summarize updates'],
    'afternoon': ['Work on main project'],
    'evening': ['Research new topics']
}

await agent.run_scheduled()  # Runs autonomously on schedule
```

### 3. **Adaptive Learning**

```python
# Agent learns from success/failure
agent.enable_reinforcement_learning()

# It will:
# - Track which approaches work
# - Adjust strategies
# - Improve over time
# - Share learnings across goals
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Let the agent work independently
- ✅ Give clear, high-level goals
- ✅ Monitor logs for insights
- ✅ Use conservative settings initially
- ✅ Save state between sessions

### DON'T:
- ❌ Micromanage the agent
- ❌ Run too many sessions (>3-4)
- ❌ Skip human behavior modes
- ❌ Ignore break patterns
- ❌ Rush the agent

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **First Run**: The agent will open a browser window for initial ChatGPT login
2. **Session Persistence**: Login saved in `~/.autonomous-agent/memory/`
3. **Rate Limits**: Agent automatically manages to avoid hitting limits
4. **Cost**: Uses your ChatGPT Plus subscription - no API costs
5. **Ethics**: Use responsibly and within OpenAI's terms of service

## 🎯 Example: Complete Autonomous Workflow

```python
async def autonomous_project():
    """Example of fully autonomous project completion"""
    
    agent = AutonomousChatGPTAgent(max_parallel_sessions=3)
    await agent.initialize()
    
    # Give it a complex goal
    await agent.pursue_goal(
        "Build a production-ready API monitoring system with alerting"
    )
    
    # Agent autonomously:
    # 1. Researches monitoring best practices
    # 2. Designs system architecture
    # 3. Writes implementation code
    # 4. Creates alerting logic
    # 5. Generates documentation
    # 6. Tests everything
    # 7. Saves all artifacts
    
    # Check results
    results = agent.get_goal_results()
    print(f"Generated {len(results['code_files'])} code files")
    print(f"Created {len(results['docs'])} documentation files")
    print(f"Completed in {results['time_taken']}")
```
