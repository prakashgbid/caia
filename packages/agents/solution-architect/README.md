# @caia/agent-solution-architect

Solution Architect Agent for designing end-to-end technical solutions within the CAIA ecosystem.

## Overview

The Solution Architect Agent is responsible for creating comprehensive technical solutions, system architectures, and integration patterns. It combines deep technical knowledge with business requirements to deliver production-ready solution designs.

## Key Capabilities

- **Solution Architecture Design**: Create end-to-end technical solutions
- **Technology Stack Selection**: Choose appropriate technologies based on requirements
- **Security Architecture**: Design secure system architectures and security patterns
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze and design for performance and scalability requirements
- **Integration Patterns**: Design integration patterns and API architectures
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Generate system architecture and design diagrams
- **Risk Assessment**: Assess technical risks and create mitigation strategies
- **Cost Estimation**: Estimate infrastructure and development costs
- **Compliance Validation**: Validate solutions against regulatory requirements
- **Deployment Architecture**: Design deployment and infrastructure architectures

## Installation

```bash
npm install @caia/agent-solution-architect
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { createSolutionArchitectAgent } from '@caia/agent-solution-architect';

// Create agent with default configuration
const agent = createSolutionArchitectAgent();

// Initialize the agent
await agent.initialize();

// Assign a task
const task = {
  id: 'arch-001',
  type: 'design_solution_architecture',
  priority: 3,
  payload: {
    requirements: {
      functional: [
        'User authentication and authorization',
        'Real-time data processing',
        'API for mobile and web clients'
      ],
      nonFunctional: [
        'Support 10,000 concurrent users',
        '99.9% availability',
        'Sub-200ms response times'
      ]
    },
    constraints: {
      budget: '$50,000',
      timeline: '6 months',
      team: 'small (3-5 developers)'
    }
  },
  createdAt: new Date()
};

await agent.assignTask(task);

// Listen for task completion
agent.on('taskCompleted', (result) => {
  console.log('Solution design completed:', result.result);
});
```

### Custom Configuration

```typescript
import { SolutionArchitectAgent } from '@caia/agent-solution-architect';
import winston from 'winston';

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [new winston.transports.Console()]
});

const config = SolutionArchitectAgent.createDefaultConfig();
config.maxConcurrentTasks = 3;
config.timeout = 600000; // 10 minutes

const agent = new SolutionArchitectAgent(config, logger);
```

## Task Types

### design_solution_architecture
Creates comprehensive solution designs including architecture, technology stack, and integration patterns.

**Payload:**
```typescript
{
  requirements: {
    functional: string[],
    nonFunctional: string[],
    security?: string[],
    performance?: string[]
  },
  constraints: {
    budget?: string,
    timeline?: string,
    team?: string,
    technology?: string[]
  },
  preferences?: {
    architecture?: string,
    deployment?: string,
    scaling?: string
  }
}
```

### select_technology_stack
Analyzes requirements and recommends appropriate technology stacks.

### design_security_architecture
Creates security architectures with threat modeling and control recommendations.

### assess_technical_risks
Performs comprehensive technical risk assessments with mitigation strategies.

### estimate_solution_costs
Provides detailed cost estimates including development, infrastructure, and operational costs.

## Architecture

The Solution Architect Agent is built using a modular service-oriented architecture:

```
SolutionArchitectAgent
├── ArchitectureGenerator    # System architecture generation
├── TechnologySelector       # Technology stack selection
├── SecurityAnalyzer        # Security analysis and design
├── PerformanceAnalyzer     # Performance analysis
├── CostAnalyzer           # Cost estimation and optimization
├── ComplianceAnalyzer     # Regulatory compliance validation
└── DiagramGenerator       # Architecture diagram generation
```

## Services

### ArchitectureGenerator
Generates system architectures based on requirements and best practices.

### TechnologySelector
Evaluates and selects appropriate technologies based on technical and business criteria.

### SecurityAnalyzer
Analyzes security requirements and designs security architectures.

### PerformanceAnalyzer
Analyzes performance requirements and designs for scalability and optimization.

### CostAnalyzer
Estimates costs and provides optimization recommendations.

### ComplianceAnalyzer
Validates architectural decisions against regulatory and compliance requirements.

### DiagramGenerator
Generates various types of architecture diagrams (system, component, deployment, etc.).

## Integration with CAIA

This agent integrates seamlessly with other CAIA agents:

- **Backend Engineer Agent**: Provides implementation guidance for solution designs
- **Frontend Engineer Agent**: Coordinates UI/UX requirements with system architecture
- **DevOps Agent**: Aligns deployment architecture with operational requirements
- **Security Agent**: Collaborates on security architecture and threat modeling
