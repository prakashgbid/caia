# ParaForge (PF) - Project Scope Definition

## 🎯 What is ParaForge?

**ParaForge is an AI-powered requirements gathering and Jira modeling framework** that transforms user ideas into comprehensive, development-ready Jira tickets through intelligent agent orchestration.

### Core Purpose
Convert a user's project idea into a **complete, structured, development-ready Jira hierarchy** where every ticket contains **ALL information needed** for uninterrupted development.

### What ParaForge IS:
- ✅ A requirements engineering framework
- ✅ An AI-powered interviewing system
- ✅ A Jira ticket structuring automation
- ✅ A multi-agent orchestration platform
- ✅ A project decomposition engine

### What ParaForge IS NOT:
- ❌ NOT a Jira replacement
- ❌ NOT a project management tool
- ❌ NOT a development platform
- ❌ NOT a collaboration suite
- ❌ NOT an enterprise software platform

## 📋 High-Level Process Flow

```
1. User provides detailed ask to Claude Code (CC)
   ↓
2. CC invokes Product Owner (PO) Agent
   ↓
3. PO conducts comprehensive interview
   - Use case clarifications
   - Feature requirements
   - Architecture preferences
   - Deployment needs
   - Integration requirements
   - Technology choices
   ↓
4. PO creates PROJECT epic in Jira (contains entire refined scope)
   ↓
5. PO creates multiple INITIATIVE epics under PROJECT
   ↓
6. For each INITIATIVE → Spawn new CC+PO instance
   - Creates detailed FEATURE epics
   ↓
7. For each FEATURE → Spawn new CC+PO instance
   - Creates detailed STORIES
   ↓
8. For each STORY → Spawn new CC+PO instance
   - Creates detailed TASKS
   - Adds comprehensive TO-DO lists
```

### Parallel Agent Involvement at Every Level:
- **Solution Architect Agent**: Technical specifications
- **UX/UI Designer Agent**: Design requirements
- **QA Agent**: Test case definitions
- **SME Agents**: Domain-specific knowledge

## 🏗️ Jira Hierarchy Structure

```
PROJECT (Complete project scope - 12+ months)
  └── INITIATIVE (Strategic objectives - 6-12 months)
      └── FEATURE (Business capabilities - 3-6 months)
          └── EPIC (Major functions - 1-3 months)
              └── STORY (User value - 3-5 days)
                  └── TASK (Technical work - 1-2 days)
                      └── TO-DOS (Checklist items - hours)
```

---

## 🎯 The Goal

**When development starts, EVERYTHING is in the ticket:**
- ✅ Complete requirements (from PO)
- ✅ Technical architecture (from SA)
- ✅ UI/UX designs (from Designer)
- ✅ Test cases (from QA)
- ✅ Dependencies identified
- ✅ Acceptance criteria defined
- ✅ To-do checklists created

**Result:** Zero interruptions during development. No questions. No blockers.
