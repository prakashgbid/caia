# üöÄ ParaForge - AI-Powered Requirements Gathering & Jira Modeling Framework

## Executive Summary
ParaForge is an intelligent framework that transforms user ideas into comprehensive, development-ready Jira tickets through AI-powered requirements gathering and multi-agent orchestration. It ensures developers have ALL information needed before starting work, eliminating interruptions and blockers during sprints.

---

## üéØ Core Value Proposition
**Zero Questions During Development**: By conducting exhaustive requirements gathering upfront through AI agents, every ticket contains complete specifications, designs, test cases, and implementation details.

---

## üìã How ParaForge Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Request
User provides their project idea to Claude Code (CC) with any level of detail

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Product Owner Interview
CC invokes specialized Product Owner (PO) Agent who conducts comprehensive discovery:
- Business objectives and success metrics
- User personas and use cases
- Feature requirements and priorities
- Technical constraints and preferences
- Integration requirements
- Deployment and scaling needs
- Security and compliance requirements
- Budget and timeline constraints

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ PROJECT Epic Creation
PO creates master PROJECT epic containing:
- Complete refined scope
- Business justification
- Success criteria
- Risk assessment
- Stakeholder map

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ INITIATIVE Breakdown
PO decomposes PROJECT into strategic INITIATIVEs (6-12 month objectives)

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Parallel Feature Development
For each INITIATIVE, spawn new CC+PO instance to create FEATURE epics (3-6 month capabilities)

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Story Generation
For each FEATURE, spawn new CC+PO instance to create user STORIES (3-5 day deliverables)

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Task Decomposition
For each STORY, spawn new CC+PO instance to create technical TASKS with TO-DO checklists

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Agent Enrichment
At every level, specialized agents contribute:
- **Solution Architect**: Technical specifications, architecture diagrams, API contracts
- **UX/UI Designer**: Wireframes, mockups, user flows, design systems
- **QA Engineer**: Test scenarios, acceptance criteria, edge cases
- **SME Agents**: Domain-specific requirements and constraints
