## üìã How to Use

### Automatic Reviews
All three reviewers will automatically analyze your PR when you:
1. Open a new pull request
2. Push new commits to an existing PR
3. Reopen a closed PR

### Interactive Reviews

#### CodeRabbit
- Comment `@coderabbitai review` to request a review
- Comment `@coderabbitai resolve` to auto-fix issues
- Comment `@coderabbitai help` for more commands

#### PR-Agent (Qodo)
- Comment `@CodiumAI-Agent /review` for a comprehensive review
- Comment `@CodiumAI-Agent /improve` for improvement suggestions
- Comment `@CodiumAI-Agent /ask [question]` to ask about the code

### Manual Triggers
You can manually trigger reviews by:
1. Re-running the GitHub Actions workflow
2. Using the reviewer commands mentioned above
3. Pushing an empty commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger AI reviews"`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### CodeRabbit
Edit `.coderabbit.yaml` to customize:
- Review triggers and branches
- Language preferences
- Path-specific instructions
- Security and performance checks

### GitHub Actions
Edit `.github/workflows/ai-pr-review.yml` to customize:
- Review prompts and focus areas
- Exclusion patterns
- API keys for enhanced features

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **CodeRabbit**: No code retention, SOC 2 Type II compliant
- **PR-Agent**: Processes code via GitHub API, no permanent storage
- **Google Gemini**: Enterprise-grade security, no training on your code

## üìä Review Requirements

Current branch protection settings require:
- **2 approving reviews** before merge
- **Code owner review** (@prakashgbid)
- **Dismissal of stale reviews** when new commits are pushed

Note: AI reviewers provide valuable feedback but don't count as approving reviews. Human review is still required for merge.

## üöÄ Best Practices

1. **Address AI feedback** before requesting human review
2. **Use interactive commands** to clarify suggestions
3. **Don't ignore security warnings** from any reviewer
4. **Combine insights** from all three reviewers
5. **Update configurations** based on project needs

## üìù Monthly Limits

- **CodeRabbit**: Unlimited (open source)
- **PR-Agent**: 75 reviews/month (reset monthly)
- **Google Gemini**: Unlimited
- **Total**: Effectively unlimited reviews

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Reviews not appearing?
1. Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow runs
2. Ensure PR is not in draft mode
3. Verify branch protection settings
4. Check monthly limits for PR-Agent

### Need more reviews?
- CodeRabbit and Gemini have no limits
- For PR-Agent, space out reviews or upgrade to paid tier
- Consider adding OpenAI API key for enhanced reviews
